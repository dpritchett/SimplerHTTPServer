Modeled on python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html), this serves files from the current working directory on port 8000.  If you want a different port, just add it as a command line argument: `./SimpleHTTPServer 80`.

Also, this is distributed as a single binary and does not require the Python interpreter.
